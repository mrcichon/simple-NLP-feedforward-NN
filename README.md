I was recently challenged to make a machine learning model that could recognize "store_number" from "Transaction descriptor".
Essentially a model made to recognize distinct, characteristic strings (i.e. sequences of numbers).
I've decided to treat it as a learning opportunity instead of using a pre-made, pre-trained NER model,
since not only would I learn nothing, the solution to the presented problem would be hilariously overcomplicated.
The network itself is incredibly simplistic, it's not even deep machine learning at the moment.
Everything was written in TensorFlow, using Keras.
